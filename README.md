# NEERG // Art Blog — V4.0

> 🔗 **Forked from [applesaucyy/lbm](https://github.com/applesaucyy/lbm)** — A little micro-blogging system for static hosting sites like NeoCities or NekoWeb.

A customizable art blog / portfolio template built on the **LBM (Leaflet Blog Manager)** engine. This fork adds a full visual theme, gallery page, commissions section, and reaction/comment system on top of the original LBM core.

## What This Fork Adds

On top of the original [LBM engine](https://github.com/applesaucyy/lbm), this version includes:

- **V4.0 Theme** — Pill nav, scroll velocity effects, staggered menu animations
- **Gallery View** — Dedicated page for showcasing artwork
- **Commissions Page** — Section for commission info and pricing
- **Reactions & Comments** — Like/dislike system with threaded comments
- **Extended Setup Wizard** — More branding options, theme colors, and custom CSS
- **Search & Tag Filtering** — Filter posts by tags (SFW, NSFW, Sketch, etc.)
- **Dark/Light Toggle** — Built-in theme switcher

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Neocities Account

Sign up at [neocities.org](https://neocities.org) if you don't already have one.

### 2. Get Your API Key

Go to your Neocities **Settings → Manage Site Settings → API Key** and copy it.

### 3. Upload Files

Upload these three files to the **root** of your Neocities site:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The main site (all pages, admin panel, everything) |
| `style.css` | All the styling |
| `interactions.js` | Stores likes, dislikes, and comments |

> **Do NOT upload a `system.js` file** — it gets generated automatically by the setup wizard.

### 4. Run the Setup Wizard

Visit your Neocities site URL (e.g., `https://yoursite.neocities.org`). The setup wizard will appear automatically. Fill in:

- **Admin password** (8+ characters — remember this!)
- **Neocities API key** (gets encrypted into a secure token)
- **Site name, tagline, colors**, etc.

Click **"GENERATE system.js"** and you're live!

---

## ⚠️ Important: Don't Run Setup From a Local File

Opening `index.html` directly from your computer (`file://...`) **will not work** for the setup wizard. The API key encryption relies on the LBM bridge, which requires an actual web server to communicate with.

**Always run the setup wizard from your live Neocities URL.**

If you want to test locally, use a local server:

```bash
# With Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

Or use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code.

## File Structure

```
your-neocities-site/
├── index.html          ← Main site (upload this)
├── style.css           ← Styling (upload this)
├── interactions.js     ← Reactions/comments (upload this)
└── system.js           ← Auto-generated by setup wizard (DO NOT upload manually)
```

---

## Customization

### From the Admin Panel (No Code Needed)

Once logged in, go to **Settings** to change:

- Site name, tagline, and copyright
- All theme colors
- Profile picture and banner image
- Reaction styles (faces, thumbs, or arrows)
- Enable/disable comments
- Custom CSS

### Advanced

The entire site is contained in `index.html` — you can edit the HTML structure directly if you're comfortable with code. `style.css` handles all styling.

---

## Forgot Your Password?

Delete `system.js` from your Neocities file manager and revisit your site. The setup wizard will reappear. Note: your posts will need to be recreated.
